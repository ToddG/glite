_The Gleamlins little intro to Erlang applications_

The Erlang documentation for applications states:
>After creating code to implement a specific functionality, you might consider transforming it into an application â€” a component that can be started and stopped as a unit, as well as reused in other systems. [<sup>1</sup>](#ref)

So how does one turn a Gleam project into an Erlang application? Well many things are already in place actually. The `gleam build`command already creates a `<project>.app`file in the in the build ebin directory (e.g. ```build/dev/erlang/glite/ebin/glite.app```), and that is what the Erlang application controller basically needs.

An Erlang application may come in two "flavours", one as a plain library like `stdlib` which does not need to start any processes, and one where the application controller starts a service with several processes under a supervision tree. For the second case the controller checks the `<project>.app` file for the `mod` property which may look like:

__build/dev/erlang/glite/ebin/glite.app__
```erlang
{mod, {'glite', []}}
```
where the second tuple contains the start module and any start arguments.

## Configuration
When `gleam run` is executed it actually starts all registered applications (those having the `mod` property set). In order to enable it in our application we need to append to the `gleam.toml` file [<sup>2</sup>](#ref):

__gleam.toml__
```toml
[erlang]
application_start_module = "glite"
```
**This will add the mod property to the `glite.app` file.**

## Callback functions
In the start module the application controller expects two callback functions, `start/2` and `stop/1`, to be implemented. 

### Gleam

Since Gleam compiles to Erlang source there is no problem to implement those in the Gleam project module, `src/glite.gleam`:

```gleam
// --------------------- Erlang/OTP Application part --------------------
/// The Erlang/OTP application start callback.
/// Responsible to start the "top" supervisor process and return its Pid
/// to the application controller.
pub fn start(_app: Atom, _type) -> Result(process.Pid, actor.StartError) {
  io.println("Application start - starts the top supervisor")
  case start_supervisor() {
    Ok(actor.Started(pid, _data)) -> {
      let sup_name = process.new_name("one_for_all_sup")
      let _ = process.register(pid, sup_name)
      Ok(pid)
    }
    Error(reason) -> Error(reason)
  }
}

/// The Erlang/OTP application stop callback.
/// This is called after all processes in the supervisor tree have
/// been shutdown by the application controller. Responsible for any
/// final clean up actions.
pub fn stop(_state: a) -> Atom {
  atom.create("ok")
}

// -------- Supervisor ----------------------------------
/// Erlang application top supervisor
fn start_supervisor() -> Result(actor.Started(sup.Supervisor), actor.StartError) {
...
```

### Erlang

You could also implement the `start/2` and `stop/1` callbacks in erlang. In this case, you would copy the `extras/glite_app.erl` to `src/` and remove the `start/2` and `stop/1` callbacks from the `src/glite.gleam` file.

## Joining the ecosystem
The benefits of doing all this is not obvious, but joining as a complete Erlang application gives the possibility to use diagnostic tools like `observer`to introspect your processes and trace messages.
> [!NOTE]
> The both the `main` function and the `start` function will be called when doing `gleam run` but only `start` if you start from an erlang shell. (`gleam shell` and then `application:ensure_all_started(glite)` for instance).
```rust
pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello from gliteapp!")
  observer_start()
  process.sleep_forever()
}

type ErlangResult

@external(erlang, "observer", "start")
fn observer_start() -> ErlangResult
```
This will bring up the observer GUI. ![](doc/observer4.png)
You can also use the `sys` functions from the Erlang shell.
```
